# There are a number of options that can be used for debugging purposes:

# set -n (bash -n) just checks for syntax
# set -x (bash -x) echos all commands after running them
# set -v (bash -v) echos all commands before running them
# set -u (bash -u) causes the shell to treat using unset variables as an error
# set -e (bash -e) causes the script to exit immediately upon any non-zero exit status
